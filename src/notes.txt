  Mike Oechsner MBA CAE CMP, Vice President of Team Development with Association Management Inc. (AMI), became Executive Director for Oregon ACP in 2023.
  AMI is a company that supports over 50 non-profit organizations in their work.

  Mike is a dedicated servant leader with over two decades experience in the non-profit sector.
  He is an experienced leader of conferences and events with over 3,000 attendees, has had success impacting funding at
    state legislature level, and is a respected leader and advisory board member with the Washington Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction.

  Mike earned his Bachelor's Degree in Education and completed student teaching.
  While going to college, he spent time working for a non-profit organization and found his passion for non-profit work.
  He is still (and always will be) a lifelong learner and teacher at heart.
  He later went on to earn his Master's Degree in Business Administration. 

  In the middle of his career, Mike also spent time in the hospitality sector -- with time as Senior Sales Manager for Martin Resorts, a small family of independently
    owned hotels on California's Central Coast,as well as time with Red Lion Hotels in Convention Sales.
  An avid scuba diver, a huge fan of anything near water, and a die hard Seahawks fan - his spare time is often spent outdoors.
  Something Mike is very proud of is the memorial scholarship that was established for his father in 1991 after his father's death from a heart attack.
  Over 30 years later, the perpetual scholarship has awarded over $200,000 to support student athletes and still holds an annual benefit slowpitch tournament each year.
  Mike leads the board for the scholarship and manages the IRS and administrative projects that go hand in hand with the non profit organization.
